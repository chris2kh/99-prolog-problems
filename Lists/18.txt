/*
P18 (**) Extract a slice from a list.
    Given two indices, I and K, the slice is the list containing the elements between the I'th and K'th element of the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.

    Example:
    ?- slice([a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,k],3,7,L).
    X = [c,d,e,f,g]
*/

slice(L,I,J,S):- In is I-1, split(L,In,_,X), 
                 K is J-I, Kn is K+1, split(X,Kn,S,_).
