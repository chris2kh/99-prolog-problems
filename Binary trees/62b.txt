/*
P62B (*) Collect the nodes at a given level in a list
    A node of a binary tree is at level N if the path from the root to the node has length N-1. The root node is at level 1. Write a predicate atlevel/3 to collect all nodes at a given level in a list.

    % atlevel(T,L,S) :- S is the list of nodes of the binary tree T at level L

    Using atlevel/3 it is easy to construct a predicate levelorder/2 which creates the level-order sequence of the nodes. However, there are more efficient ways to do that.
